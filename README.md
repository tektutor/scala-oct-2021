- functional programming languages encourage you develop lock free applications

Scala

 - functional programming language
 - suitable for concurrent programming
 - suitable for machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence based applications
 - ideal for developing big data applications
 - functions can accept regular data types as well functions as arguments
 - value of functions can be assigned to variables
